[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_cpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit_cpp" with
  any of the following names:

    moveit_cppConfig.cmake
    moveit_cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "moveit_cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "moveit_cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
